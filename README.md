# pdftohtmlforsquirt
This small python3 app is intended for use in conjunction with squirt or another online speed-reading application. It uses PyPDF and regex to strip PDF files of their formatting and save them as text files, then creates html versions of the files to be locally hosted. These locally hosted files can then be viewed with a web browser using the web address '127.0.0.1:8000', and applets like squirt applied to enable speed-reading at up to 5000 wpm.
